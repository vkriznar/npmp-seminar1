    We want to find out whether a function f: {0, 1}^n -> {0, 1} is balanced or constant
    Lets take a simple function f: f(0)=1, f(1) = 1
    We are working with qubits, so a bit with value 0 is represented with a vector [1, 0]
        and bit 1 is represented with [0, 1]
    Matrix representation of this function acting on a single qubit takes the form
    Nf = [[0, 0],
          [1, 1]].
    It holds: Nf @ zero = one
          and Nf @ one = one
        where zero, one are 0, 1 qubit vectors and @ is matrix multiplication
    To use a function (matrix) in a quantum circuit, it has to be unitary (U* @ U = I).
    To make the operation reversible (unitary matrix), we use a control bit and define a new function:
    f = lambda x, y: (x, Xor(y, Nf @ x))
    The corresponding unitary matrix takes the form
    Uf = [[0, 1, 0, 0],
          [1, 0, 0, 0],
          [0, 0, 0, 1],
          [0, 0, 1, 0]]

        [0, 0, 0, 1],
        [0, 0, 1, 0]
    ])

    # we use the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
